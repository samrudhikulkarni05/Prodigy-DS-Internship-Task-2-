Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a publicly available dataset to explore variable relationships, patterns, and trends.

# Dataset
For this task, I used the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains detailed information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, such as age, class, gender, and survival status.

Tools and Libraries Used

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization



# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I carried out the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values in features like Age and Cabin, removed duplicates, and standardized formats.

Exploration & Visualization: Analyzed variable relationships such as Survival vs Gender, Pclass, and Age. Used bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps to find patterns in the dataset.



# Conclusion

The EDA provided key insights into survival trends aboard the Titanic. For instance, women and children had higher survival rates, and passengers from higher classes were more likely to survive. These insights are foundational for predictive modeling tasks that may follow.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
